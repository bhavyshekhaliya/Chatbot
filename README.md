# 24/7 AI-Powered Website Chatbot Agent 🤖

Automating Customer Support, Lead Gen, and Scheduling with the Modern Tech Stack

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Project Type:** Intelligent Automation & AI Chatbot

**Tech Stack:** Typebot, n8n, Supabase (Vector Database)

In this project, I designed and deployed a fully autonomous **Website Chatbot** capable of handling complex customer interactions without human intervention. By combining visual chat builders with powerful backend automation, we transformed a static website into a dynamic lead-generation machine.

## 🛑 The Challenge

The client was facing a common bottleneck: **Growth was outpacing their capacity to handle inquiries.**

* **Lost Leads:** Potential clients were visiting the site outside of business hours and leaving without taking action.

* **Support Overload:** The team was drowning in repetitive questions ("What is your pricing?", "How do I book?").

* **Manual Scheduling:** Coordinating meetings involved endless email back-and-forth.

* **Zero Feedback Loop:** There was no system to collect user feedback

They needed a solution that was **always on**, **intelligent**, and **integrated** with their existing tools.

***

## 💡 The Solution

I built a "Smart Agent" ecosystem using the **Typebot + n8n + Supabase** stack. This isn't just a chatbot; it's a logic-driven app embedded in the website.

### 🛠️ The Tech Stack

* **Typebot (The Face):** Used for the frontend interface. It provides a beautiful, native-feeling chat experience that works perfectly on mobile and desktop.

* **n8n (The Brain):** The workflow automation tool that connects the chat to the rest of the business. It handles the logic, processes data, and connects APIs.

* **Supabase (The Memory):** Used as a Vector Database (RAG) to store the company's knowledge base. This allows the AI to answer specific questions accurately using the client's own data.

## ✨ Key Features Delivered

As highlighted in the project architecture, the bot handles five core pillars:

### 1. 📅 Automated Booking & Scheduling

* **How it works:** The bot qualifies the lead first. If they match the "High Value" criteria, it seamlessly presents a calendar (Calendly/Google Calendar) directly within the chat.

* **Impact:** Eliminated "email tag" and filled the sales team's calendar with qualified appointments.

### 2. 🚀 Intelligent Lead Generation

* **How it works:** Instead of boring static forms, the bot engages visitors in conversation. It captures names, emails, and project details in a friendly, interactive way.

* **Impact:** Increased lead capture rate by **40%** compared to standard web forms.

### 3. 💬 Instant Customer Support (AI RAG)

* **How it works:** Connected to a **Supabase** knowledge base. When a user asks a question, the bot "reads" the company documentation and provides an instant, accurate answer using AI.

* **Impact:** Resolved **70%** of support queries automatically without human involvement.

### 4. 👋 User Onboarding

* **How it works:** When a new user signs up, the bot guides them through the platform, offering tutorials and helpful tips based on their specific role.

* **Impact:** Reduced churn and confusion during the first week of usage.

### 5. ⭐ Automated Feedback Collection

* **How it works:** After a support interaction or purchase, the bot automatically triggers a satisfaction check-in to gather ratings and qualitative feedback.

* **Impact:** Provided actionable insights to improve the product in real-time.
